                            My creative journey started in 2020 when I decided to learn not just learn to code as a skill but to make it my entire career.
                            I discovered a burining desire to create aesthetically pleasing websites that create ground breaking solutions.
                            Since then I've never looked back and as hard as it is to beleive my laptop is basically my child, following me everywhere because I find coding very relaxing.
